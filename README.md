# SUMMER | ABOUT US
We are a group of people who are not very experienced in the world of configuration but we try to contribute with what we have.
Please note that all the scripts we include are open source so you can use them as you wish.
If there is something wrong or out of the ordinary, report the error without insulting or making fun of the group.

# SUMMER | SUPORT OUR TEAM
Our projects will always remain free and open-source, with our core developers working voluntarily.
If you love what we do and want to help us continue, why not show your appreciation with a donation?
